-   **Improve Per-Host Settings**
    -   I don't like the (hostname == "host") stuff. I'll probably add a laptop desktop type to hosts config and toggle settings based on that. Razer specific stuff needs to move into the hosts/shin folder instead of doing it in HM.
-   **Misc**
    -   Emoji/Color Picker
    -   Window Switcher
-   **Battery Tweaks**
    -   Getting somewhere around 3-4 hours, that's not great.
    -   Goal is 7 hours for browsing/coding and 2 hours of video playback
